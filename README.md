# What is a cell type? 

By Tiago Lubiana

A chronological collection of the core scientific articles discussing the concept of cell type, cell state, and similar concepts.

Comments on each publication reflect my own summarized view on each piece. Some might be longer, some might be shorter. I'll try to keep them to ~ 1 paragraph. 

I have some focus on categorizing cell types for understanding human biology in the context of the Human Cell Atlas, but considerations across species might be present nevertheless.

If you have additional articles that you think should be featured, just add an issue!

A pledge for an ontogenetic tree as the reference for classifying cell types. It brings exciting points of view, but misses essential literature such as [Jeff Doyle's "Cell types as species: Exploring a metaphor"](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.868565) and the whole Cell Ontology endeavor. It extends the ontogenetic classification of *C. elegans* to other organisms, but requires critical technical advances before applying to humans.

An in-depth dissection of the analogy between organizing cells in types and organizing individual organisms in species. For different facets, such as "Philosophical underpinnings', Jeff Doyle explores the cell type side and the species side, finalizing with synthesis and outstanding questions. With an impressive coverage of the literature, and the clarity of the writing, the article is a must-read, and under-discussed in the human cell type community.

- Bernstein, MN.  [On cell types and cell states](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/cell_types_cell_states/)  - Blog. 2021 Mar 03

Very interesting blogpost, with a computer-science oriented mindset and graph representations. Claims that , *the concept of cell type is human-made*, *in nature there are only cell states* and *cell types are a subset of cell states*, which creates a logical inconsistency. 

That inconsistency stems out of the fact that "state" is used for two things:
 * the certain configuration of each cell (well described by Bernstein) 
 * an abstract grouping (set) of similar cells given certain properties that might not be stable 

The state space is a man-made space of these abstract groupings that reflect the many certain configurations out there. 
These states are as human-made as the cell types. 

The certain configurations, however, are nature-made, and might have patterns that enable decent groupings. 

By "*cell types are a subset of cell states*", what probably was intended was that "each cell type corresponds to a subset of the *set* of states". Bernstein is talking about a particular cell and its states alongside its life cycle. That assumes a certain individual as a reference tree, and cell types would be defined for the reference and inferred for the whole species, a decent thought experiment. In this case, there exists a set of cell states for an individual, and any particular conjunction of such cell states could be called a cell type _for that individual_.  

I very much appreciate the use of knowledge graphs and ontologies for organizing information, alongside Bernstein.
