# What is a cell type? 

A chronological collection of the core scientific articles discussing the concept of cell type, cell state, and similar concepts.

There is a focus on categorizing cell types for understanding human biology in the context of the Human Cell Atlas, but considerations across species might be relevant nevertheless.

If you have additional articles that you think should be featured, just add an issue!

- Domcke, S., & Shendure, J. (2023). [A reference cell tree will serve science better than a reference cell atlas](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.02.016). Cell, 186(6), 1103-1114.

A pledge for an ontogenetic tree as the reference for classifying cell types. It brings exciting points of view, but misses essential literature such as [Jeff Doyle's "Cell types as species: Exploring a metaphor"](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.868565) and the whole Cell Ontology endeavor. It extends the ontogenetic classification of *C. elegans* to other organisms, but requires critical technical advances before applying to humans.


## 2022 

- Doyle, J. J. (2022). [Cell types as species: Exploring a metaphor.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.868565). Frontiers in Plant Science, 13, 868565. Doyle, Jeff J.  Frontiers in Plant Science 13 (2022): 868565.

An in-depth dissection of the analogy between organizing cells in types and organizing individual organisms in species. For different facets, such as "Philosophical underpinnings', Jeff Doyle explores the cell type side and the species side, finalizing with synthesis and outstanding questions. With an impressive coverage of the literature, and the clarity of the writing, the article is a must-read, and under-discussed in the human cell type community.
