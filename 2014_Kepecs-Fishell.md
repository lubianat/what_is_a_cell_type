### Kepecs A, Fishell G. [Interneuron cell types are fit to function.](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12983) Nature. 2014 Jan 16;505(7483):318-26.

A somewhat niche review focusing on interneurons, but provides insights for the larger classification of cell types. Provides a summarizing standpoint stating that they*the large diversity in interneuron classes may originate from a handful of cardinal cell types* (...) *we hope (we) will help to direct future studies by consolidating interneuron diversity into cardinal classes with specific ground states.*. They go further to consider that *nature has conspired to bestow on* (interneurons) *generalized computational function that necessitated the presence of common biophysical and hodological properties*

I like the wording of *cardinal classes*, as it is precisely vague in stating that these classes are important, even in absolute, developmentally-determined nature. They bring the interesting perspective of a core parts-list of neurons, that is somewhat malleable and can be employed in different contexts. Or, as the say, *a limited set of building blocks to create enormous diversity circuits*.

An additional note is that they deal with 4 main different criteria combined to classify interneurons: morphology, connectivity pattern, markers, and "intrinsic properties" (firing patterns, I suppose). Also considers in detail the development of interneurons from *discrete proliferative regions*. Nevertheless, mentions that  *referring to an interneuron's origin as deriving from a specific embryonic structure may be an imprecise proxy for gene expression*.

I do wish they had provided an actual list of "cardinal classes" of interneurons, even if provisional. Of note, the concept of "cardinal classes" is not super hot on the scientific literature, with 8 pubmed hits (Jul 2023, [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22cardinal+classes%22+%2B+neuron)). It seems to fare better in the spinal chord community, with 2021 articles in Science and Nature Communications bearing the names [*"Conserved genetic signatures parcellate cardinal spinal neuron classes into local and projection subsets"*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abe0690) and [*"A harmonized atlas of mouse spinal cord cell types and their spatial organization"*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25125-1), neither citing this review.  A 2023 article on Neuron, [*"Cortical somatostatin interneuron subtypes form cell-type-specific circuits"*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2023.05.032), however, uses the concept for cardinal classes for cortical interneurons as a whole and does cite this review.
